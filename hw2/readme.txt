0. Assumption
	The program use   pnmtojpeg software to convert pnm to jpeg image. Make sure you have pnmtojpeg installed in your computer

1. Contents in folder:
     ./sequential_heat_distribution.c 
	the sequntial program of heat distribution project
     ./MPI_heat_distribution.c
	the parallel version of heat distribution project using MPI
     ./seq_graph.jpg:
	a heat distribution image example in jpeg format generated by sequential_heat_distribution.c program with settings: number of cpus= 1, iterations=5000, image size=1000 by 1000

      ./mpi_graph.jpg:
	the heat distribution image example in jpeg format generated by MPI_heat_distribution program with settings: number of cpus= 16, iterations=5000, image size=1000 by 1000

      ./mpi_graph_50000.jpg:
	example image generated by MPI_heat_distribution program with 50000 iterations and 1000 x 1000 grid size and cpus =16

      ./makefile:
	makefile to  compile the C files.

2. Compile files
	if using makefile I write, then
		Command to compile sequential program:
			make sequential_heat_distribution

		Command to compile parallel program:
			make MPI_heat_distribution

	Otherwise:
		mpicc sequential_heat_distribution.c -o sequential_heat_distribution

		mpicc MPI_heat_distribution.c -o MPI_heat_distribution

3. Run programs
	3.1 Note:
		If there is no inputs to programs, then the default grid size =1000 x 1000 with 5000 iterations
	Example:
		mpiexec -n 1 sequential_heat_distribution
		mpiexec -n 16 MPI_heat_distribution
	These two examples use 1000x1000 grid and 5000 iterations

	The sequential_heat_distribution program will generate images "seq_graph.jpg" and "seq_graph.pnm"
	The MPI_heat_distribution program will generate images "mpi_graph.jpg" and "mpi_graph.pnm"

	3.2 Commmand to run sequential program with 1 cpu, 1000x1000 grid, 5000 iterations:
		mpiexec -n 1 sequential_heat_distribution 1000 5000

	3.3 Command to run parallel program with 16 cpus, 1000x1000 grid, 50000 iterations:
	mpiexec -n 16 MPI_heat_distribution 1000 50000
